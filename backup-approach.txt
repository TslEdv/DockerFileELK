Since all of the services run in Docker containers, one backup approach could be to create a cron job to reguraly backup the containers.

But for more specific service backup strategies here are some possibilities:

Elasticsearch - Data can be backed up using its built-in snapshot and restore functionality. 
We can create snapshots of Elasticsearch data and store them on a separate disk or in a cloud-based storage service.

Logstash - Configurations can be backed up by copying the configuration files to a separate location (in our case - Github). 
Additionally, it's recommended to periodically export and save any important logs data that Logstash generates to a separate location.

Kibana - Can be backed up by exporting saved objects like visualizations, dashboards and searches.

Prometheus -  We store Prometheus configuration in Github. Also can be backed up by backing up its data directory.
This directory contains all the data that Prometheus has collected, including metrics, alerts, and rules.

Grafana - can be backed up by exporting the dashboards and panels. Currently we have the main.json panel, Grafana Configurations
and the datasources in the Github.

cAdvisor - all of the metrics are collected by Prometheus, backing up Prometheus would be sufficient.

In any case, the backup files should be stored in a secure location that is separate from the primary environment, whether thats another
disk or the cloud.
